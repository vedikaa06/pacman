#clone game
This Pac-Man Clone, built with Python and Pygame, features smooth controls, ghost movement, and a scoring system. Players navigate a maze, collect pellets, and use power-ups to defeat ghosts. With retro graphics and sound effects, it's a great project for learning game development in Python.
